## Current Status: PHASE 3 COMPLETED - FRONTEND COMPONENTS BUILT
**Last Updated**: Frontend components implemented
**Session**: 1

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Read and analyzed MVP specification
- [x] Created comprehensive development plan
- [x] Identified technology stack and architecture
- [x] Created project directory structure
- [x] Set up frontend React app with TypeScript
- [x] Set up backend Node.js app with TypeScript
- [x] Created shared types.ts with ArgumentNode and ArgumentEdge interfaces
- [x] Configured TypeScript for both frontend and backend
- [x] Set up Tailwind CSS configuration
- [x] Created environment configuration files
- [x] Installed all dependencies
- [x] Created comprehensive README.md
- [x] Backend server successfully started and tested
- [x] Health endpoint working correctly
- [x] API endpoint responding (needs OpenAI key for full functionality)
- [x] Fixed OpenAI SDK compatibility issues for Node 12
- [x] Created Zustand store for state management
- [x] Implemented ArgumentCanvas with React Flow
- [x] Created custom ArgumentNode component with editing
- [x] Built InteractionPanel component for generating arguments
- [x] Created API service for backend communication
- [x] Updated App.tsx with complete UI layout
- [x] Added localStorage persistence

## Current Phase: Phase 4 - Integration & Testing
**Goal**: Connect frontend to backend and test complete functionality

### Next Steps
1. **Resolve Frontend Build Issues**
   - Fix TypeScript version compatibility (Node 12 limitation)
   - Resolve minimatch type definition issues
   - Get development server or build working

2. **Test End-to-End Integration**
   - Test frontend-backend communication
   - Verify argument generation flow
   - Test localStorage persistence

3. **Polish & Deploy**
   - Add error handling and user feedback
   - Test responsive design
   - Prepare for deployment

## Key Decisions Made
- Project name: Dianoia (changed from Argos)
- Technology stack confirmed: React + TypeScript + React Flow + Zustand + Tailwind CSS (frontend), Node.js + Express + TypeScript + OpenAI SDK (backend)
- Architecture: Three-tier separation (Frontend, Backend API, LLM Service)
- Persistence: Browser localStorage for MVP

## Environment Requirements
- Node.js (v16+)
- npm/yarn
- OpenAI API key
- Development ports: 3000 (frontend), 5000 (backend)

## Files Created
- `DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md` - Comprehensive development roadmap
- `progress.md` - This progress tracking file

## Notes for Next Session
- Start with Phase 1: Project Setup & Foundation
- Ensure all environment variables are properly configured
- Focus on establishing solid foundation before moving to implementation
- Test each component as it's built

## Blockers/Questions
- Need confirmation on environment setup preferences
- Need OpenAI API key for LLM integration
- Need to confirm package manager preference (defaulting to npm)
